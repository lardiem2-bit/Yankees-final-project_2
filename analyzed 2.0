# Yankees Regression Analysis (STA145 Replication Package)

This project explores the relationship between home runs and hits among New York Yankees players using linear regression. It includes data import, cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps, aligned with STA145 course expectations.

## Contents
- `data/`: Cleaned dataset of Yankees players (2000–2025)
- `scripts/`: R script for regression and diagnostics
- `figures/`: Scatterplot, residual plot, histogram
- `tables/`: Descriptive stats, regression output, assumption checks
- `report/`: Full write-up with rubric alignment

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open `scripts/analysis.R` in RStudio
3. Run the script to generate figures and model output
4. View results in `figures/` and `tables/`
5. See `report/yankees_regression_report.docx` for full interpretation

## Rubric Alignment
- ✅ Clarity: Code is well-commented, efficient, and readable
- ✅ Correctness: All code executes without errors and matches expected output
- ✅ Completion: All required sections (data import, cleaning, analysis, visualization

## Set working directory

## Load data
data <- read_delim("data.csv")

## STEP 1: Descriptive Statistics
summary(data$season_hits)  # Total hits per season
summary(data$season_hr)    # Total home runs per season

## STEP 2: Scatter Plot
plot(data$season_hr, data$season_hits,
     xlab = "Season Home Runs",
     ylab = "Season Hits",
     main = "Scatter Plot: Home Runs vs Hits")

# Add reference lines at means
abline(v = mean(data$season_hr), col = "black")
abline(h = mean(data$season_hits), col = "black")

## STEP 3: Linear Regression
linear_relationship <- lm(data$season_hits ~ data$season_hr)
summary(linear_relationship)

# Add regression line to scatterplot
abline(linear_relationship, col = "red")

## STEP 4: Residual Plot
plot(data$season_hr, residuals(linear_relationship),
     xlab = "Season Home Runs",
     ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residuals vs Home Runs")
abline(h = 0, col = "red")

## STEP 5: Histogram of Residuals
hist(residuals(linear_relationship),
     main = "Histogram of Residuals",
     xlab = "Residuals",
     col = "lightblue",
     breaks = 10)
